# InfoSense

This repository contains code for InfoSense, a University of Washington capstone project focused on improving health literacy and patient autonomy for young adults ages 18–26. The project explores how digital tools can help patients better understand medical jargon found in clinical notes and laboratory reports, empowering them to make more informed healthcare decisions.

The system emphasizes plain-language explanations, accessibility, and trust by grounding information in reliable medical sources and presenting it in a way that is easy to understand and navigate.

# Problem Statement

Many patients, especially young adults, struggle to understand the medical terminology used in clinical and laboratory reports. Complex jargon, unclear trends, and language barriers can lead to confusion, anxiety, and reduced confidence when making healthcare decisions.

InfoSense addresses this challenge by translating medical information into plain language, providing contextual definitions, and highlighting trends across reports to help users build understanding over time.
